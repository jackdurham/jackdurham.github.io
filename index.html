            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>In my previous job, I worked as a stock controller for the Fire and Rescue Service. I eventually decided to have some time for myself and travel across America for six months, where I spent the majority of my time in Seattle, during my time there I learnt to become more independent. While there, I found out about coding bootcamps, a new opportunity to pursue a career I’ve always dreamed of, so when I came back to London, I decided to join the 3-month Web Development Immersive programme at General Assembly.</p>

              <p>I have always been interested in how computers and technology worked and I’ve felt that it was the right industry for me. I love the creative side of development and being able to add my own flair and personality to something out in the world for others to see and being able to solve problems is a huge, fun part of the process for me.</p>

              <p>I’m looking to be part of a collaborative environment where I can continue to develop my skills throughout my career and feel excited to go to work and be in the offices.</p>

              <p class="info">My fourth project was a MERN stack app, I really enjoyed using the React framework I feel like it has a lot of potential. The premis of Playlister is to be able to keep track of your favorite artists and music by using the YouTube API and saving the tracks to your profile. There is also the ability to follow other users to see what music they are enjoying.</p>

              <p class="info">This was my first time working on a group project, I felt it was important for all team members to feel comfortable and to know what direction the project was going from the start. So because of that we we talked extensively about the project before starting any code. It was a MEAN stack application using Bootstrap as a CSS framework.</p>

              <p class="info">My second project was built using EJS and Node, this was my first real look into the back end of development and at first I struggled but by the end of the project I felt comfortable with it. Game Reviews is a RESTful app where you can register an account and leave reviews for your favorite video games that other users then have the ability to comment on.</p>

              <p class="info">My first ever project was a basic JavaScript game, I really enjoyed making this as it was the start of my journey into development and my first real challenge. It is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the concept is simple there is a hoop that moves from side to side, and as it lines up with the ball at the bottom you press the button to shoot it into the hoop and register a score, with each score the hoop gets quicker.</p>
